    "# An End-to-End Text Classification System\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshop you will implement a text classification system from scratch. This means that we will not rely on Keras' convenient data sets. These data sets are pre-processed and it will be useful if you know how to tokenise and find the word indices of text collections not provided by Keras.\n",
    "\n",
    "The task will be to classify questions. To run this task we advice that you use [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com) (also called Google Colab), which is a cloud solution to run Jupyter notebooks. The demonstrator will show how to use Google Colab. For additional information and to practice with the use of notebooks in Google Colab, you can also follow this link:\n",

    "The histogram shows that the longest question in the training data has 18 word indices, but by far most of the questions have at least 10. Based on this, use Keras' `pad_sequences` to vectorize the questions into sequences of 10 word indices. The default will be to truncate the beginning, but we want to truncate the end (since the first words of a question are often very important to determine the question type). For this you can use the option `truncating='post'`: https://keras.io/preprocessing/sequence/"
