    "We will use data that has been derived from the **BioASQ challenge** (http://www.bioasq.org/), after some data manipulation to make it easier to process for this assignment. The BioASQ challenge organises several \"shared tasks\", including a task on biomedical semantic question answering which we are using here. The data are in the file `bioasq10_labelled.csv`, which is part of the zip file provided. Each row of the file has a question, a sentence text, and a label that indicates whether the sentence text is part of the answer to the question (1) or not (0).\n",
